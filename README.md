# Prim

**A file that stores information, and tools that interact with it.**

There are Prims and Prim Tools.

**Prims** are the store: files both agents and humans can use without scraping a sheet or a deck. Traditional documents (Excel, Word, PDFs, decks) become projections.

**Prim Tools** operate on a Prim. Two kinds: surface (human counterpart) and connector (system counterpart). A tool cites the file. It is not a Prim.

OKF is one grammar some prims use. Prim can evolve without being OKF.

> “Send me the prim.”

That should feel as natural as “send me the link” or “drop the JSON.”

**New here?** Read [WHAT-IS-PRIM.md](./WHAT-IS-PRIM.md) — the complete explanation and how to talk about it.

## Why Prim exists

Most knowledge today lives in application-specific files:

- Spreadsheets for structure
- Documents for narrative
- Decks for presentation
- Notes for memory

None of these were designed for agents. They require constant translation, re-interpretation, and re-derivation.

**Prims invert this.**

The store *is* the file. Interfaces are generated or operated on the fly. OKF is optional. Pure data formats (images, Parquet, etc.) remain specialized. Everything else can become a view of a Prim.

## Core properties

- **Store + interact** — the file stores; a surface or connector cites it
- **AI-native** — agents open the store without scraping a presentation format
- **Durable** — outlives a session
- **Human-inspectable** — still openable by people
- **No fixed UX** — `ui` opens; a Prim Tool operates
- **OKF optional** — evidence, trust, fail-closed are profile rules when the domain is claims

## Packaging

| Form | Role |
|------|------|
| **Directory pack** | Canonical source of truth (git, editing, validation) |
| **`.prim.zip`** | Primary interchange — “send me the prim” |
| **`.prim.tar.gz`** | Allowed, Unix/agent-friendly |
| **`.prim`** | Reserved branded container (zip-compatible) |

A `.prim.zip` or `.prim` is simply a zip whose root is a valid Prim pack.  
See [SPEC.md §5](./SPEC.md) for the full packaging rules.

## Naming

| Pattern | Role |
|---------|------|
| **`prim`** | This repo — category home |
| **`prim.<profile>`** | Domain profile (spec + validator + examples) |
| **`prim-web`** | Public web surface |
| **Prim Tool** | Operator on a Prim — **surface** (human) or **connector** (system). Not a repo pattern. |

Examples: `prim.ocsf`, `prim.obif`, `prim.osf`, `prim.orf`. There is no `prim.surface` or `prim.connector`.

## The Prim family

| Repo | Domain |
|------|--------|
| [prim](https://github.com/eidos-agi/prim) | Category identity (this repo) |
| [prim-web](https://github.com/eidos-agi/prim-web) | Public surface / views |
| [prim.emf](https://github.com/eidos-agi/prim.emf) | Human intent + durable memory |
| [prim.orf](https://github.com/eidos-agi/prim.orf) | Research / investigation |
| [prim.opf](https://github.com/eidos-agi/prim.opf) | Product graph |
| [prim.odwf](https://github.com/eidos-agi/prim.odwf) | Spreadsheet → bronze proof |
| [prim.opff](https://github.com/eidos-agi/prim.opff) | Personal finance + `opff-editor` (surface / talk, as ledger) |
| [prim.omf](https://github.com/eidos-agi/prim.omf) | Meeting occurrences |
| [prim.ocsf](https://github.com/eidos-agi/prim.ocsf) | Corporate structure & capital |
| [prim.obif](https://github.com/eidos-agi/prim.obif) | Brand & identity |
| [prim.osf](https://github.com/eidos-agi/prim.osf) | Open Session Format |
| [prim.docket](https://github.com/eidos-agi/prim.docket) | Execution prim + first Prim Tool (`docket-editor`, surface / talk) |
| prim.deck | Slide records + `deck-editor` (emerging) |
| prim.invoice | Bill pack + `invoice-editor` (emerging) |
| prim.session | Thin transcript + `session-editor` (emerging; not OSF) |

OKF provides the grammar ([okflify](https://github.com/eidos-agi/okflify)).  
**Prim** is what people call the thing.

See [FAMILY.md](./FAMILY.md) for composition rules and how to talk about profiles.

## Language

- “Send me the prim.”
- “Is that the latest prim?”
- “Don’t send the spreadsheet — just send the prim.”
- “The prim is the source of truth. The deck is just a view.”
- “Brand prim” / `prim.obif` when you need the profile.
- “There are prims and prim tools.”
- “A surface tool on this prim.” / “A connector that cites this prim.” — not a new pack type.

## Status

Early. Types and tools are listed in [`registry/registry.json`](./registry/registry.json). `prim registry` prints them. Domain profiles live in `prim.<name>` repositories. They do not have to be OKF.
